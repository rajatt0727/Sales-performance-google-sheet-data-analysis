# Problem Statement: Sales and Profit Performance Optimization

## Background
The company operates across various segments and markets, selling a range of products to different customer types. 
Managing sales, profit, and cost-effectiveness has been a challenge, especially in tracking how different segments, products, and regions perform.
The company needs a better way to visualize its overall sales data to identify which segments and products are most profitable, and how discounts, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross sales contribute to net profits. 

## Problem
Without a unified system to track these critical business metrics, decision-making becomes difficult. The leadership cannot easily determine which regions, segments, or products are underperforming, nor can they efficiently allocate resources to high-performing areas. A clear breakdown of profits and sales by different segments and products is needed to make data-driven decisions.

Key challenges include:
- Lack of visibility into **sales trends** over time across different products and regions.
- Difficulty in identifying the most **profitable products** and regions for strategic decision-making.
- Inability to quickly assess the **impact of discounts** on net sales and profit margins.
- Lack of segmentation to compare how different customer types (e.g., Government, Small Business, Midmarket) contribute to overall sales.

## Solution
The **Interactive Sales Dashboard** provides a comprehensive view of the companyâ€™s sales and profit performance, answering the following key business questions:
- What are the **gross sales** and **net sales** over the past year by month?
- Which **products** and **regions** are driving the most profit?
- How do **different customer segments** contribute to overall sales performance?
- What is the impact of **discounts** on the final profit margin?

### Key Features of the Dashboard
- **Net Sales by Month**: A line chart visualizing the company's sales performance across months, identifying trends and seasonal variances.
- **Profit by Country**: A pie chart highlighting the most profitable countries, allowing better regional strategies.
- **Sales by Segment**: A bar chart that breaks down sales by customer segment, helping to prioritize key segments like Government or Small Business.
- **Profit by Product**: A waterfall chart showing which products contribute most to the company's profits, aiding in product strategy.
- **Gross Sales, Discounts, Net Sales, COGS, and Profit**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed at the top for immediate access to the most important metrics.

## Conclusion
The dashboard enables the leadership team to make informed decisions about where to invest resources, how to manage discounting strategies, and which regions and products to prioritize to optimize profitability. 
This unified view of sales data empowers the company to streamline operations and improve overall performance.
